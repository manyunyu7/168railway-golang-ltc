# Race Conditions Fixed - Documentation

This document details the race conditions that were identified and fixed in the live tracking system, along with the procedures and solutions implemented.

## Overview

The original implementation had several critical race conditions that could lead to data corruption, lost updates, and inconsistent state between the database and S3 storage. These have been comprehensively fixed with thread-safe operations, mutexes, and database transactions.

## Race Condition #1: Multiple Train File Updates

### **Problem**
When multiple users were on the same train, concurrent updates to the same S3 train file could cause data corruption:

```go
// BEFORE (Race Condition):
trainData, err := h.s3.GetTrainData(fileName)    // User A reads
trainData.Passengers[i].Lat = newLat             // User A modifies
// Meanwhile User B also reads the same file...
h.s3.UploadJSON(fileName, trainData)             // User A writes
// User B writes, overwriting User A's changes!
```

### **Solution**
Implemented per-train mutex locks to ensure atomic read-modify-write operations:

```go
// AFTER (Thread-Safe):
trainMutex := h.getTrainMutex(session.TrainNumber)
trainMutex.Lock()
defer trainMutex.Unlock()

trainData, err := h.s3.GetTrainData(fileName)    // Locked read
trainData.Passengers[i].Lat = newLat             // Safe modify
h.s3.UploadJSON(fileName, trainData)             // Locked write
```

### **Implementation Details**
- Added `trainMutexes map[string]*sync.Mutex` to handler struct
- Protected the mutex map itself with `mutexLock sync.RWMutex`
- Each train gets its own dedicated mutex via `getTrainMutex(trainNumber)`

### **Procedure Now**
1. **StartMobileSession**: Acquires train mutex before checking/creating train file
2. **UpdateMobileLocation**: Acquires train mutex before updating passenger data
3. **StopMobileSession**: Acquires train mutex before removing passenger or deleting file
4. All S3 operations on train files are now atomic and thread-safe

---

## Race Condition #2: Trains List Updates

### **Problem**
Multiple requests updating `trains-list.json` simultaneously could corrupt the file:

```go
// BEFORE (Race Condition):
// Multiple users calling updateTrainsList() concurrently
h.s3.GetJSONData("trains/trains-list.json")     // Multiple reads
// Build new trains list...
h.s3.UploadJSON("trains/trains-list.json", data) // Concurrent writes!
```

### **Solution**
Added dedicated mutex for trains list updates:

```go
// AFTER (Thread-Safe):
func (h *SimpleLiveTrackingHandler) updateTrainsList() {
    h.trainsListMutex.Lock()    // Only one update at a time
    defer h.trainsListMutex.Unlock()
    
    // Safe to read, modify, and write trains-list.json
}
```

### **Implementation Details**
- Added `trainsListMutex sync.Mutex` to handler struct
- All calls to `updateTrainsList()` are now serialized
- Prevents concurrent modifications to the central trains list file

### **Procedure Now**
1. Any operation that triggers trains list update acquires the dedicated mutex
2. Only one trains list update can happen at a time across the entire system
3. Trains list file integrity is guaranteed

---

## Race Condition #3: Database-S3 Consistency

### **Problem**
Database updates could succeed while S3 operations failed, leading to inconsistent state:

```go
// BEFORE (Inconsistent State):
h.s3.UploadJSON(fileName, trainData)              // Could fail
h.db.Create(&session).Error                       // Could succeed
// Result: DB says "active session" but no S3 file exists!
```

### **Solution**
Implemented database transactions with proper rollback handling:

```go
// AFTER (Consistent State):
tx := h.db.Begin()
defer func() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
        tx.Rollback()
    }
}()

// S3 operation first
if err := h.s3.UploadJSON(fileName, trainData); err != nil {
    tx.Rollback()  // Rollback if S3 fails
    return
}

// Database operation only if S3 succeeded
if err := tx.Create(&session).Error; err != nil {
    tx.Rollback()  // Rollback if DB fails
    return
}

tx.Commit()  // Both succeeded
```

### **Implementation Details**
- All critical operations wrapped in database transactions
- S3 operations performed before database operations where possible
- Proper error handling with rollbacks on any failure
- Panic recovery with automatic rollback

### **Procedure Now**
1. **StartMobileSession**: Transaction wraps S3 upload + DB session creation
2. **UpdateMobileLocation**: Transaction wraps S3 update + DB heartbeat update
3. **StopMobileSession**: Existing transaction handling maintained
4. If any step fails, entire operation is rolled back to maintain consistency

---

## Race Condition #4: Multiple Users Joining Same Train

### **Problem**
When multiple users joined the same train simultaneously, the train file could be overwritten instead of merged:

```go
// BEFORE (Data Loss):
// User A and User B both try to join Train 123
trainData := models.TrainData{
    Passengers: []models.Passenger{newUser}, // Only one user!
}
// Second user overwrites first user's data
```

### **Solution**
Proper handling of existing train files with passenger merging:

```go
// AFTER (Proper Merging):
trainMutex := h.getTrainMutex(req.TrainNumber)
trainMutex.Lock()
defer trainMutex.Unlock()

existingTrainData, err := h.s3.GetTrainData(fileName)
if err != nil {
    // New train file - create fresh
    trainData = createNewTrainData()
} else {
    // Existing train - add new passenger
    trainData = *existingTrainData
    trainData.Passengers = append(trainData.Passengers, newPassenger)
    h.recalculateAveragePosition(&trainData)
}
```

### **Implementation Details**
- Check for existing train files before creating new ones
- Append new passengers to existing passenger list
- Recalculate train averages when adding passengers
- Mutex protection ensures atomic file operations

### **Procedure Now**
1. **StartMobileSession** first checks if train file exists
2. If exists: Loads existing data and appends new passenger
3. If new: Creates fresh train file with first passenger
4. All operations are mutex-protected to prevent race conditions
5. Train statistics (average position, passenger count) are recalculated properly

## Implementation Summary

### **New Handler Structure**
```go
type SimpleLiveTrackingHandler struct {
    db              *gorm.DB
    s3              *utils.S3Client
    trainMutexes    map[string]*sync.Mutex // Per-train locks
    mutexLock       sync.RWMutex           // Protects mutex map
    trainsListMutex sync.Mutex             // Trains list lock
}
```

### **Key Functions Added**
- `getTrainMutex(trainNumber string) *sync.Mutex`: Returns train-specific mutex
- Transaction wrapping in all critical operations
- Proper error handling with rollbacks
- Existing train file detection and merging

### **Thread Safety Guarantees**
1. ✅ **No more train file corruption** from concurrent updates
2. ✅ **No more trains list corruption** from simultaneous writes  
3. ✅ **Consistent database-S3 state** via transactions
4. ✅ **Proper passenger merging** when joining existing trains
5. ✅ **Atomic read-modify-write operations** for all S3 files

### **Performance Impact**
- **Minimal overhead**: Mutexes only block same-train operations
- **Better scalability**: Different trains can be updated concurrently
- **Improved reliability**: No data loss or corruption
- **Consistent state**: Database and S3 always synchronized
