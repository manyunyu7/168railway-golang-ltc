# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a high-performance Golang replacement for Laravel live tracking API endpoints, designed to handle real-time GPS location tracking for train passengers. The application integrates with an existing Laravel system's database and validates Laravel Sanctum tokens for authentication.

**Production URL**: https://go-ltc.trainradar35.com/

**Current Implementation Status**: Database + S3 implementation with Redis disabled for easier deployment. The production version uses S3 for train data storage with database session tracking and debug logging enabled.

## Core Architecture

- **Framework**: Gin (HTTP router) with GORM (ORM)
- **Database**: MySQL (shared with Laravel app)
- **Cache**: ~~Redis for session management~~ (Currently disabled)
- **Storage**: S3-compatible storage (IDCloudHost) for train data files
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum token validation (SHA256 hashing)

### Key Components

- `cmd/main.go` - Application entry point, S3-enabled implementation without Redis
- `config/config.go` - Environment configuration loading with godotenv
- `middleware/auth.go` - Laravel Sanctum token authentication with debug logging
- `handlers/simple_live_tracking.go` - Live tracking API endpoints (using `NewSimpleLiveTrackingHandler`)
- `models/models.go` - Database models matching Laravel schema
- `utils/s3.go` - S3 client for train data storage

### Data Flow (Current S3-Enabled Implementation)

1. Mobile app gets Bearer token from `https://168railway.com/api/mobile/login` (Laravel)
2. Mobile app calls Golang API with Bearer token
3. Golang API validates token against shared `personal_access_tokens` table with debug logging
4. User creates tracking session stored in database (replaces Redis cache)
5. Location updates stored as JSON files in S3 with real-time updates
6. Session termination saves trip data to `trips` table with complete GPS tracking history

**Important**: The Golang API shares the same MySQL database with the Laravel application but doesn't make HTTP requests to 168railway.com.

## Common Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run in development mode
go run cmd/main.go

# Build binary
go build -o bin/golang-live-tracking cmd/main.go

# Run built binary
./bin/golang-live-tracking
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Stash any local changes (server is only for deployment, not development)
git stash --all

# 2. Pull latest code from repository
git pull

# 3. Rebuild the binary (Go is compiled, not interpreted)
go build -o go-ltc cmd/main.go

# 4. Restart the systemd service (NOT manual process)
sudo systemctl restart go-ltc

# 5. Check if service is running properly
sudo systemctl status go-ltc

# 6. Test the health endpoint
curl https://go-ltc.trainradar35.com/health
```

**Important Deployment Notes**:
- **Environment Configuration**: The `.env` file must exist at `/var/www/go-ltc/.env` with correct database credentials (DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, etc.) and S3 configuration (S3_ACCESS_KEY, S3_SECRET_KEY, S3_REGION, S3_BUCKET, S3_ENDPOINT)
- **Service Management**: Always use systemd to manage the service (`sudo systemctl restart go-ltc`), NOT manual nohup commands
- **Build Required**: Go is a compiled language - changes won't take effect until you rebuild with `go build` AND restart the service
- **Check Logs**: If issues occur, check systemd logs with `sudo journalctl -u go-ltc -n 50`
- **Silent Success**: When `go build` runs without output, it means the build succeeded (Go only shows errors, not success messages)

**Common Issues**:
- If service fails to start: Check `.env` file exists and has correct DB_USERNAME (not DB_USER) and S3 configuration
- If endpoints return 404: Ensure you've rebuilt the binary and restarted the service
- Database connection errors: Verify `.env` has correct credentials matching the Laravel application's database
- S3 "MissingRegion" errors: Ensure S3_REGION is set in `.env` file (e.g., S3_REGION=us-east-1)

### Docker
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t golang-live-tracking .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env golang-live-tracking
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests (if any exist)
go test ./...

# Test specific package
go test ./handlers

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

## Environment Configuration

Configure environment variables:
- Database credentials (must match Laravel app's MySQL)
- ~~Redis connection details~~ (Currently unused)
- S3 storage configuration (S3_ACCESS_KEY, S3_SECRET_KEY, S3_REGION, S3_BUCKET, S3_ENDPOINT)
- Server port (default 8080)

**Production Environment**: The live server at https://go-ltc.trainradar35.com/ is configured with the necessary database connections and S3 storage.

## API Integration Details

### Authentication Flow
- Mobile apps obtain Bearer tokens from `https://168railway.com/api/mobile/login`
- Golang API validates tokens against shared Laravel `personal_access_tokens` table
- SHA256 hashes only the token part after "|" (Laravel Sanctum format: "id|token_string")
- Matches both token ID and hashed token in database
- Updates `last_used_at` timestamp on each request
- Validates token expiration if `expires_at` is set
- **Debug logging enabled** in production for troubleshooting
- **No HTTP calls to Laravel**: Direct database validation only

### Session Management (Database-backed)
- ~~Redis keys: `live_session_{sessionID}` and `user_sessions_{userID}`~~ (Replaced with database)
- Session data stored in `live_tracking_sessions` table with train info, timestamps, S3 file paths
- API endpoints provide full session tracking with S3 integration

### S3 Train Data Structure
- Files stored as `trains/train-{number}.json` with real-time passenger data
- Contains passenger array with GPS coordinates, timestamps, and tracking details
- Automatic cleanup when no passengers remain on the train
- Active trains list maintained in `trains/trains-list.json`

## Database Schema Compatibility

Models are designed to match Laravel's database schema:
- `User` -> `users` table
- `PersonalAccessToken` -> `personal_access_tokens` table  
- `Trip` -> `trips` table with JSON columns for tracking data

## Performance Considerations

- ~~Redis caching for session lookups~~ (Replaced with database sessions)
- Efficient S3 operations with proper error handling for train data storage
- GORM optimizations with proper indexing
- Gin middleware for CORS and authentication
- Database auto-migration disabled to avoid key length issues with existing Laravel tables

## Health Monitoring

**Production Health Check**: https://go-ltc.trainradar35.com/health
- Returns `{"status": "ok", "service": "golang-live-tracking"}`
- Confirms service is operational and database connectivity

## Production Testing

Test authentication with curl:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LARAVEL_SANCTUM_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://go-ltc.trainradar35.com/api/mobile/live-tracking/active-session
```

**Note**: Debug logging is enabled in production, so server logs will show token validation details for troubleshooting.
